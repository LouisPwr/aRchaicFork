\title{Prepare and aggregate mismatch feature counts MFF files in a study}
\usage{
archaic_prepare(
  dirs,
  max_pos = 20,
  one_mismatch = FALSE,
  from_scratch = FALSE,
  delete = FALSE,
  output_rda = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirs}{The directory/directories containing the MFF files.}

\item{max_pos}{The maximum position from the ends of the reads for which
mismatches are considered in aRchaic.}

\item{one_mismatch}{Boolean indicating whether to use only reads containing
one mismatch. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{from_scratch}{Boolean indicating whether to perform data preparation
from scratch and regenerate the .RData file.
The alternative would be look for the .RData file and
update that file accordingly, based on the MFF (.csv)
files present in the directory. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{delete}{Boolean indicating whether to delete from the .RData file,
if present, rows corresponding to the files that are not
present in the directory.}

\item{output_rda}{If non-NULL, the processed data for each
directory in \code{dirs} is saved as a .Rdata file.}
}
\value{
Returns a list with number of elements same as the number of
elements/directories in the directory vectors \code{dirs}. Each of these
elements is a matrix with rows being samples (each MFF file), the
columns representing the mismatch signatures (comprising of features like
mismatch type, flanking bases and strand break information) and the cells
of the matrix reporting counts of the number of times a mutational signature
of a given type is observed in an MFF file.
}
\description{
For each file in a directory in the directory vector \code{dirs},
aggregates the mismatch feature counts data from the Mismatch Feature Format
(MFF) files to form a single .RData file that is saved in the given directory.
