\arguments{
\item{file}{a MismatchFeatureFormat (MFF) .csv file.}

Check the input parameters of \code{damageLogo5()} for the control parameters.}

of mismatch features against a modern background - else
uses a background with equal probability of all mismatch
features.}

\item{title}{The name of the sample. If not provided, defaults to the filename.}

\item{output_file}{The filename (with path) of the constructed logo plot.}
