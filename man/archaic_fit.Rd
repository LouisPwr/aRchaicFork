using DNA damage patterns}
\usage{
archaic_fit(
  dat,
  K,
  tol = 0.1,
  labs = NULL,
  gom_method = "independent",
  gom.control = list(),
  output_dir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Either
(a) output from \code{archaic_prepare} or
(b) a vector of directories hosting the MFF files that the user
    wants to jointly model
(c) a matrix of counts with samples along the rows and the mismatch
    signatures along the columns with entries reporting the counts.}

\item{K}{the number of clusters to fit to the model.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance level of convergence of the GoM model fit}

\item{labs}{The factor of labels used to group the samples in visualization.
May be used to distinguish
samples from different labs, or different library prep.}

\item{gom_method}{The GoM method type. Defaults to \code{independent} model proposed by
Shiraishi2015. The other option is to use the \code{full}
model which is uses the implementation due to Taddy2012.}

\item{gom.control}{Control parameters for the GoM model fit.}

\item{output_dir}{The output directory where the model is saved.
If NULL, it picks the current working directory.}
}
\value{
Fits a GoM model on the aggregated data from \code{archaic_prepare}
  and outputs both the clusters (represented by mismatch signature frequencies)
  and the mixing proportion of clusters represented in each sample/MFF file.
  It also returns an assessment score like the BIC, to compare the models.
}
\description{
Performs a mixed membership model clustering of aDNA samples
using DNA damage patterns- mutation, flanking base, distance from read end
and strand break information. The default implementation of this model
follows the modeling framework of Shiraishi et al (2015).
